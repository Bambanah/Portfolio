I was a bit annoyed by the lack of good startpage options out there, so I made my own.

This is a startpage designed by me to look pretty and be functional for my needs. The current implementation of it is vanilla HTML, JS and CSS, however I have plans of expanding the functionality of the site to be more modular and able to store user data using an authentication system.

Ideally, anyone would be able to use this startpage and make it their own. Additionally, there is a lot of room for growth in the amount of customisation that is possible in the design and layout of the startpage.
